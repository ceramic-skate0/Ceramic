# Ceramic
A simple .Netcore application i built to do Red Teaming things for me. shhh this mean you can run it on Limnux and Windows :)
Also its a compile it your self kinda thing. If your unaware of how to do this Please Google it like a Red Teamer.


# Usage:

            CeramicSkate0's 1 stop shop in dotnet core to do random Red Team tasks via 1 app.  
            Cuz I cant remember all the random commandline ares to do it.      
            So yes things are case sensitive and yes the commandline inputs must be in order shown below.

            Commandline Params:

            -b64 {Input File Path}
            The command above will base64 encode a input file and save it to an output file.

            -xor {Input .bin File Path} {XOR KEY}
            The command above will xor a .bin file with a key and output it to a file. This mean when you un xor it you will need the same key.
